					<h2>About Me</h2>
					
					<hr/>

					<img src="assets/images/duncan-portrait-sm.jpg" alt="Handsome Picture of Duncan Iaria"/>
					<p>I like video games, drums, biking, Star Wars, and web development. Isn't that interesting? Not really - but hey I used to be in a rock band. That was pretty fun. Unfortunately, there was no money in it for me, and you kind of need money to survive in a capatalistic society, so I decided to do computer stuff as a job. It's all good though - cuz I love computers too.</p>
					
					<br/>

					<p>I went to school for Animation and Interactive Media, so mostly I've got an art and design background. Currently I make web apps and games (mostly training related). It's a pretty sweet gig, but I'd like to work at a web development company here in Atlanta (I currently work remotely - which is cool, but not ALL the time, as I DO like people occasionally). Anyway, look on my works ye mighty, and despair!</p>
